## Repository Structure

- **BehavioralSelfReport/**  
  Scripts for processing and summarizing behavioral and self-report measures collected alongside fMRI data.

- **UnivariateGLM/**  
  Subject-level and group-level univariate general linear model (GLM) analyses for Hot, Warm, and Imagine conditions.

- **PrecisionFunctionalSVM/**  
  Precision functional mapping using cross-validated support vector machines (SVMs) to identify subject- and body site–specific nociceptive representations and test their generalization across conditions and sessions.

- **RepresentationalSimilarity/**
